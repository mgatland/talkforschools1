      <h2>Patient Record</h2>
      <p>
        - Name<br>
        - Address<br>
        - What hospital bed you're in<br>
        - X-ray photos<br>
        - Allergies<br>

      <div class="notes">All this information comes from messages, that different systems sent to each other. So, when you arrive at hospital, someone signed you in - the sign-in system sends a message, saying 'Matthew Gatland is in Ward 1, Bed 1.' Or after a blood test, the blood lab sends a message saying 'Here are Matthew Gatland's blood test results.'</div>

      <div class="notes">Anyway, it's a typical morning, and we check our email and find out there's a problem at Lahey Clinic. The messages that are sent between hospital systems seem to be coming in the wrong order.<br>

      Note that something weird is happening around 2 AM.</div>

      <h1>What now?</h1>
      <div class="notes">There's a bug in the software. We can fix it in the next version. But hospitals are big organisations, they can be really slow - it might take 6 months before the hospital is ready to install a new version of the software on all their computers.<br>
      The doctors and nurses need the information in those messages right now, this morning.
      <br>
      So fixing the bug isn't enough - we need a quick fix.

        2) 2:35 AM &#8594; 2:01 AM<br>

        4) 2:10 AM &#8594; 2:03 AM<br>
        5) 2:40 AM &#8594; 2:04 AM<br>
      </p>
      <div class="notes">We decide to hack the messages then send them in again. We'll change the times so they look like they come in the right sequence. I know it'll fix the issue because I know the code really well.<br>
      But there's one problem.<br>
      I'm not a doctor. Or a nurse. These messages contain clinical data - it could be life or death stuff. I can't just go changing messages around unless I know it's safe to do so.</div>

* Fix the bug in the next version of the software<br>
* Ask customers to get ready to install the new version<br>

      <div class="notes">You have to click 'Close' on this patient record, then open the patient list (click), then click on the next patient's name, then click 'open'. Nilu says: this action is repeated so many times, we should add one great big "Next Patient" button.</div>

      <div class="notes">Most importantly, the user. For one project, I was flown with my team to Canberra in Australia so we could actually watch a nurse go around taking blood samples out of people.<br>
        To really see it happen gave us a whole lot of insights we never would have had before.
        We're used to working with 2 screens, on big desks, all together in our office. But the nurse walks around a building with a trolley - if there's going to be a computer it has to fit on there - and it's already mostly full of blood stuff.
